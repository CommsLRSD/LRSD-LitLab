# TIER 1 FLOWCHART: Universal Screening and Core Instruction

## Tier 1 Overview
Tier 1 is the universal screening and core instruction level. It applies to all students in the classroom. The goal is to identify students who need additional intervention and to monitor the effectiveness of general curriculum instruction.

---

## Tier 1 Flow

### Step 1: Review Principles of Explicit and Systematic Instruction
**Action:** Educator reads through and checks off all 8 principles of explicit and systematic instruction.
- These principles should be displayed as a checklist the educator completes
- User must check all 8 boxes to proceed to the next step

### Step 2: Administer Literacy Screener
**Action:** Educator administers a literacy screening assessment to the class.
- This is the initial universal screening assessment

### Step 3: Input Screener Results
**Action:** Educator enters the results from the screener into the app.
- Results are entered as individual subtest scores
- Results are classified by color code: Blue, Green, Yellow, or Red

### Step 4: Evaluate Results - Does the General Curriculum Work for Most Students?
**Decision Point:** Look at the subtest results across the class.

**Path A: Instruction is Effective (Blue or Green Results)**
- Most students show strong performance (Blue or Green)
- **Next Action:** Success! Continue teaching with the general curriculum and monitor progress with regular assessments
- No intervention needed at this time

**Path B: Instruction is Ineffective (Yellow or Red Results)**
- Many students show weak performance (Yellow or Red)
- **Decision Point:** How many students are struggling?

#### Path B1: 20% or More of Students Show Weak Results
- The general curriculum instruction is not working for a significant portion of the class
- **Next Action:** Reteach using the general curriculum. Look at the specific areas of weakness shown by the screener. Find evidence-based resources from the Interventions Menu (filter by Tier 1). Consider adjusting core instruction based on needs.
- **Menu Access:** The Interventions Menu should be accessible here with a Tier 1 filter applied by default

#### Path B2: Fewer Than 20% of Students Show Weak Results
- Only a small number of students are struggling
- **Next Action:** These individual students need small group intervention. Move to Tier 2.
- **Next Step:** Access Tier 2 Flowchart

---

# TIER 2 FLOWCHART: Small Group Intervention

## Tier 2 Overview
Tier 2 is for students who do not respond adequately to Tier 1 instruction. Students receive targeted intervention in small groups for an 8-week cycle. Progress is monitored and decisions are made to continue, adjust, or move to Tier 3.

---

## Tier 2 Flow

### Step 1: Review Principles of Explicit and Systematic Instruction
**Action:** Educator reads through and checks off all 5 principles of explicit and systematic instruction for Tier 2.
- These may be slightly different from Tier 1 principles
- User must check all 5 boxes to proceed to the next step

### Step 2: Administer Drill Down Assessment
**Action:** Use the Interventions Menu to select and administer a drill down assessment.
- The drill down assessment should align with the areas of weakness identified by the literacy screener
- **Menu Access:** The Interventions Menu should be accessible here with a Tier 2 filter applied and "Drill Down Assessments" selected by default
- This assessment provides more detailed information about specific skill gaps

### Step 3: Deliver 8-Week Intervention
**Action:** Use the Interventions Menu to find and select an appropriate small group intervention.
- The intervention should match the student's specific needs identified by the drill down assessment
- Implement for an 8-week period
- During the 8 weeks, monitor student progress regularly using progress monitoring tools
- **Menu Access:** The Interventions Menu should be accessible here with a Tier 2 filter applied and "Interventions" selected by default

### Step 4: Conduct Progress Monitoring Assessment
**Action:** After the 8-week intervention period ends, administer the regularly scheduled literacy screener.
- Acceptable screeners are: DIBELS, CTOPP-2, THaFoL, or IDAPEL
- Results are classified by color code: Blue, Green, Yellow, or Red

### Step 5: Evaluate Progress - Did the Student Improve?
**Decision Point:** Look at the subtest results from the progress monitoring assessment.

**Path A: Student Shows Improvement (Blue or Green Results)**
- The student made good progress during the 8-week intervention
- **Next Action:** Success! Gradually fade the intervention support while continuing to monitor. Return to Tier 1 core instruction with monitoring
- **End of Cycle:** Student progresses back to Tier 1

**Path B: Student Shows No Improvement (Yellow or Red Results)**
- The student did not make expected progress
- **Next Action:** Try a different approach. Repeat the Tier 2 cycle with an adjusted intervention.

#### Tier 2 Cycle 2: Second 8-Week Intervention

### Step 6: Administer Another Drill Down Assessment
**Action:** Use the Interventions Menu to select a different or more targeted drill down assessment.
- This assessment should provide additional detail about why the first intervention was not effective
- **Menu Access:** The Interventions Menu should be accessible here with a Tier 2 filter applied and "Drill Down Assessments" selected by default

### Step 7: Deliver Second 8-Week Intervention
**Action:** Use the Interventions Menu to find a different intervention approach.
- Select an intervention that is different from the first one or targets the issue more intensively
- Implement for an 8-week period
- Monitor student progress during this 8-week period
- **Menu Access:** The Interventions Menu should be accessible here with a Tier 2 filter applied and "Interventions" selected by default

### Step 8: Conduct Second Progress Monitoring Assessment
**Action:** After the second 8-week intervention period ends, administer the regularly scheduled literacy screener.
- Same screeners: DIBELS, CTOPP-2, THaFoL, or IDAPEL
- Results are classified by color code: Blue, Green, Yellow, or Red

### Step 9: Evaluate Second Cycle Progress - Did the Student Improve?
**Decision Point:** Look at the second progress monitoring results.

**Path A: Student Shows Improvement (Blue or Green Results)**
- The student made good progress in the second intervention
- **Next Action:** Success! Gradually fade the intervention support. Return to Tier 1 with monitoring.
- **End of Cycle:** Student progresses back to Tier 1

**Path B: Student Still Shows No Improvement (Yellow or Red Results)**
- The student has not made expected progress after two 8-week cycles
- **Issue:** This indicates the student likely needs more intensive, specialized support
- **Next Action:** Move to Tier 3. This student should receive individual or highly specialized intervention.
- **Note:** Ideally, fewer than 10% of students should require Tier 3 intervention

---

# TIER 3 FLOWCHART: Intensive Individual Intervention

## Tier 3 Overview
Tier 3 is for students who have not responded to two cycles of Tier 2 intervention. These students receive intensive, individualized intervention. This is typically a small percentage of students (fewer than 10%).

---

## Tier 3 Flow

### Step 1: Begin Tier 3 Process
**Action:** Click "Begin Tier 3" button to start the intensive intervention process.
- Educator confirms they have completed Tier 2 and the student requires additional support
- Review principles of explicit and systematic instruction for intensive intervention

### Step 2: Administer Drill Down Assessment
**Action:** Use the Interventions Menu to select a highly targeted drill down assessment.
- This assessment should provide very detailed information about the student's specific literacy gaps
- The assessment helps identify which intensive intervention approach is most appropriate
- **Menu Access:** The Interventions Menu should be accessible here with a Tier 3 filter applied and "Drill Down Assessments" selected by default

### Step 3: Deliver 8-Week Intensive Intervention
**Action:** Use the Interventions Menu to find an intensive, specialized intervention.
- Select an intervention designed for Tier 3 that matches the student's specific needs
- Implement for an 8-week period
- Monitor student progress **weekly** during this period (more frequent than Tier 2)
- Use progress monitoring tools to track response to intervention
- **Menu Access:** The Interventions Menu should be accessible here with a Tier 3 filter applied and "Interventions" selected by default

### Step 4: Conduct Progress Monitoring Assessment
**Action:** After the 8-week intensive intervention period, administer the regularly scheduled literacy screener.
- Acceptable screeners are: DIBELS, CTOPP-2, THaFoL, or IDAPEL
- Results are classified by color code: Blue, Green, Yellow, or Red

### Step 5: Evaluate Progress - Did the Student Improve?
**Decision Point:** Look at the progress monitoring results.

**Path A: Student Shows Improvement (Blue or Green Results)**
- The student made progress with intensive support
- **Next Action:** Success! Gradually fade intervention while continuing to monitor closely. The student may return to Tier 1 or remain in Tier 2 with reduced support depending on the level of improvement.
- **End of Cycle:** Student progresses with reduced intervention intensity

**Path B: Student Shows No Improvement (Yellow or Red Results)**
- The student has not responded to intensive intervention
- **Next Action:** This student needs specialized assessment and support beyond what this app can provide. Schedule a meeting with clinicians (special education staff, speech-language pathologists, school psychologists, etc.) to discuss next steps.
- **Menu Access:** Provide a link to clinician contact information
- **Note:** The student may require formal special education assessment or medical evaluation

## Interventions Menu

The Interventions Menu is a filterable database accessible throughout the app. It has two main modes:

### Mode 1: Drill Down Assessments
Shows detailed assessment tools that help identify specific skill gaps. Available for each tier.
- Can be filtered by: Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3
- Shows description of what skill each assessment measures
- Provides instructions for administration

### Mode 2: Intervention Resources
Shows evidence-based intervention strategies and resources. Available for each tier.
- Can be filtered by: Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3
- Shows description of the intervention
- Provides links to resources or materials
- Indicates which literacy skills the intervention targets

---

## Color Code System

The app uses a consistent color-coding system for assessment results:

- **Blue:** Strong performance, skill demonstrated
- **Green:** Adequate performance, skill present
- **Yellow:** Below benchmark, skill needs attention
- **Red:** Well below benchmark, immediate intervention needed

---

## Key Principles for Coding Agent

1. **Decision Points:** When the same bullet level has multiple items (Path A, Path B, etc.), these represent mutually exclusive choices based on a decision criterion. The app should direct users down only one path based on their input.

2. **Sequential Steps:** When items are indented to a deeper level, this represents the next action after the previous step is complete. Users progress vertically down the flowchart.

3. **Menu Access:** When the Interventions Menu is needed, it should open with specific filter defaults pre-selected (e.g., Tier 2, Drill Down Assessments). Users can override filters if needed.

4. **Repeating Cycles:** Tier 2 and Tier 3 include repeated cycles (8-week intervention → assessment → evaluation). The app should allow users to restart the cycle if the student doesn't show improvement.

5. **Assessment Tools:** The app should store assessment results and display them alongside the color codes for easy reference.

6. **Links Between Sections:** Certain areas need to link between sections (e.g., Tier 1 decision point links to Tier 2 Flowchart, Tier 3 result links to Clinician contacts).

7. **Checkbox Completion:** Steps that require reading principles or guidelines should have a checkbox system to ensure educators complete the step before moving forward.

8. **Progress Tracking:** The app should maintain a history of a student's journey through the tiers, including dates of assessments and which interventions were tried.
