                <h3>Making Data-Informed Decisions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look at trends over time, not just a single score</li>
                    <li>Consider multiple measures and data sources</li>
                    <li>Compare student performance to both benchmarks and their own previous performance</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the rate of improvement (slope) for students receiving interventions</li>
                    <li>Use data to determine if interventions should be continued, modified, or discontinued</li>
                    <li>Consider other factors such as attendance, language background, and specific learning needs</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Questions to Ask When Reviewing Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the student meeting grade-level benchmarks?</li>
                    <li>Is the student making adequate progress over time?</li>
                    <li>Are there specific skill areas where the student struggles?</li>
                    <li>Is the current intervention effective? (Is the student's rate of improvement adequate?)</li>
                    <li>Do we need to adjust the intensity, duration, or type of intervention?</li>
                    <li>What are the student's strengths that we can build upon?</li>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p class="description">Common questions about literacy interventions and Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS).</p>
                
                <h3>General Questions</h3>
                
                <h4>What is MTSS?</h4>
                <p>Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) is a framework for providing academic and behavioral support to all students. It uses data to identify students who need additional support and provides increasingly intensive interventions based on student needs.</p>
                
                <h4>What is the difference between Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tier 1:</strong> High-quality core instruction for all students in the general education classroom. About 80% of students succeed with Tier 1 alone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Supplemental interventions for students who need additional support beyond core instruction. Typically provided in small groups. About 15% of students need Tier 2.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 3:</strong> Intensive, individualized interventions for students with significant needs. About 5% of students need Tier 3 support.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>How long should a student receive an intervention before making changes?</h4>
                <p>Generally, interventions should be implemented with fidelity for 6-8 weeks before making decisions about effectiveness. However, progress monitoring data should be reviewed regularly (weekly for Tier 3, bi-weekly to monthly for Tier 2) to ensure the student is responding to the intervention.</p>
                
                <h3>Assessment Questions</h3>
                
                <h4>What is the purpose of universal screening?</h4>
                <p>Universal screening helps identify students who may be at risk for reading difficulties so they can receive early intervention. It provides a snapshot of all students' skills and helps schools allocate resources effectively.</p>
                
                <h4>How often should students be progress monitored?</h4>
                <p>The frequency depends on the tier level:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tier 1: 3 times per year (fall, winter, spring screening)</li>
                    <li>Tier 2: Every 2-4 weeks</li>
                    <li>Tier 3: Weekly</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>What if a student doesn't make progress with Tier 2 interventions?</h4>
                <p>If a student doesn't respond adequately to Tier 2 interventions after 6-8 weeks, consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increasing the intensity (more time, smaller group, more explicit instruction)</li>
                    <li>Changing the intervention approach</li>
                    <li>Moving to Tier 3 for more intensive support</li>
                    <li>Conducting additional diagnostic assessments to better understand the student's needs</li>
                    <li>Considering a referral for special education evaluation if appropriate</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Intervention Questions</h3>
                
                <h4>How long should intervention sessions last?</h4>
                <p>Intervention duration varies by tier:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tier 2: Typically 20-30 minutes per session</li>
                    <li>Tier 3: Typically 30-60 minutes per session</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sessions should be in addition to, not instead of, core literacy instruction.</p>
                
                <h4>What is the ideal group size for interventions?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tier 2: Small groups of 3-6 students with similar needs</li>
                    <li>Tier 3: Very small groups of 1-3 students or one-on-one</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Can students receive more than one intervention at a time?</h4>
                <p>Students can receive multiple interventions if they address different skill areas (e.g., one for decoding and one for comprehension). However, be mindful of the total intervention time to avoid overwhelming the student or taking too much time away from other important learning opportunities.</p>
                
                <h4>Should interventions replace core instruction?</h4>
                <p>No. Interventions should be provided in addition to core literacy instruction, not as a replacement. Students need access to both high-quality core instruction and targeted interventions to address their specific needs.</p>
                
                <h3>Family Communication</h3>
                
                <h4>How should I communicate with families about interventions?</h4>
                <p>Best practices include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explain what the data shows about their child's current performance</li>
                    <li>Describe the intervention plan in clear, jargon-free language</li>
                    <li>Emphasize that interventions are proactive support, not punishment</li>
                    <li>Share progress regularly (at least once per marking period)</li>
                    <li>Provide suggestions for home support</li>
                    <li>Welcome questions and input from families</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>What can families do at home to support literacy development?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read aloud together daily</li>
                    <li>Practice high-frequency words</li>
                    <li>Play word games and rhyming activities</li>
                    <li>Visit the library regularly</li>
                    <li>Talk about stories and ask questions about what was read</li>
                    <li>Encourage writing for authentic purposes (lists, letters, stories)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Implementation Questions</h3>
                
                <h4>Who should provide interventions?</h4>
                <p>Interventions can be provided by various educators depending on the tier and school resources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classroom teachers</li>
                    <li>Reading specialists/interventionists</li>
                    <li>Special education teachers</li>
                    <li>Title I teachers</li>
                    <li>Trained paraprofessionals (with supervision)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>More intensive interventions (Tier 3) should be provided by the most experienced and specialized staff.</p>
                
                <h4>How do I find time for interventions in my schedule?</h4>
                <p>Strategies for scheduling interventions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designate a specific intervention block in the daily schedule</li>
                    <li>Use flexible grouping during literacy centers or stations</li>
                    <li>Coordinate with specialists to maximize small-group time</li>
                    <li>Consider before or after school programs for some students</li>
                    <li>Prioritize and protect intervention time as essential instruction</li>
                </ul>
