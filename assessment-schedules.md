# English and French Immersion Program Assessment Schedules

> **Note**: This document serves as the human-readable source of assessment schedule information. The interactive calendar and table views in the web application are driven by `data/assessment-schedules.json`, which is derived from the content in this document. Any updates to assessment schedules should be made to both this document and the JSON file to keep them in sync.

This document explains, in plain language, the two visual schedules you shared:

- **English Program Assessment Schedule**
- **French Immersion Program Assessment Schedule**

Both charts show **when different assessments happen across the school year**, from **before school starts** through **June**, and how they differ by **program** (English vs. French Immersion) and **grade level**.

Common visual elements on both charts:

- **Columns** = Months of the school year (plus a "Before school year" column).
- **Rows** = Grade groupings.
- **Coloured blocks with test names** = When specific assessments are given.
- **Dark grey horizontal bars** = "Intervention period" – the stretch of time when teachers provide extra support and monitor progress between major assessments.
- **Small circle with a clipboard icon** = When **report card marks are due**.
- **Asterisks (*) next to test names in April** = Special rule: if a student did **not meet the benchmark in the Winter assessment**, teachers must give **all subtests** of that assessment again in April.

Below is a detailed explanation of each chart.

## 1. English Program Assessment Schedule

The English Program chart is organized by:

- **Grade bands**: Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grades 2–8
- **Time**: Before school year, September through June
- **Key assessments**:
  - **Kindergarten questionnaire**
  - **CTOPP‑2** (a phonological processing assessment)
  - **DIBELS** (a reading/early literacy assessment with multiple subtests)

### 1.1. Kindergarten (English Program)

**Before school year**

- Families complete a **Kindergarten questionnaire** before school starts. This helps staff learn about the child’s background, development, and needs.

**Fall (September–October)**

- Students complete **CTOPP‑2** once in the fall of Kindergarten. This checks key early literacy skills such as phonological awareness and phonological memory.

**November**

- A **report card is due** (clipboard icon appears in November). Teacher comments and marks reflect:
  - Observation and classroom work
  - Information from the Kindergarten questionnaire
  - Early assessments and beginning-of-year learning

**Winter (January)**

- Kindergarten students complete **DIBELS (Winter)**.
  - DIBELS consists of several **subtests** (for example, letter naming, phonemic awareness, etc.).
  - These subtests help identify which students are on track and which students need extra support in early reading skills.

**Intervention period (roughly November–April)**

- A **dark grey bar** spans several months in the Kindergarten row.
- This means that after the fall assessments and the November report, teachers:
  - Provide **targeted interventions** (small-group or one‑on‑one help)
  - Monitor students’ progress
  - Adjust instruction leading up to the next major assessment in April

**March**

- Another **report card is due** in March, summarizing progress mid‑year and reflecting both classroom learning and the Winter DIBELS data.

**Spring (April)**

- Kindergarten students complete **DIBELS (Spring)** again.
- This Spring DIBELS is used to:
  - Measure growth since Winter
  - Decide whether continued or different interventions are needed

**June**

- A final **report card is due** in June.
- This report card reflects overall year‑end progress, including Spring DIBELS results and classroom performance.

**Special note for Kindergarten (English Program) starting in 2025–2026**

The notes at the bottom specify a change beginning with the **2025–2026 school year**:

- **CTOPP‑2 will only be given once in the fall of Kindergarten.**
- During Winter and Spring:
  - Teachers must administer both **Letter Naming Fluency (LNF)** and **Phonemic Segmentation Fluency (PSF)** subtests of DIBELS to **all** Kindergarten students.

### 1.2. Grade 1 (English Program)

**September–October (Fall DIBELS)**

- Grade 1 students complete **DIBELS** early in the school year.
- This establishes a baseline for reading skills.

**November**

- A **report card is due** in November.
- Teacher reporting is informed by:
  - Fall DIBELS results
  - Classroom work and observations

**January (Winter DIBELS)**

- Grade 1 students complete **DIBELS (Winter)** again.
- Winter results show whether students are meeting benchmarks and whether fall interventions are working.

**Intervention period (November–April)**

- A **dark grey bar** runs across the winter and early spring months.
- During this period teachers:
  - Provide extra support to students who are below benchmark
  - Monitor progress and adjust instruction

**March**

- A **report card is due** in March.
- This report reflects ongoing progress and Winter DIBELS outcomes.

**April (Spring DIBELS)**

- Grade 1 students complete **DIBELS (Spring)**.
- Spring DIBELS helps determine end‑of‑year reading status and whether students met grade‑level benchmarks.

**June**

- A **report card is due** in June, summarizing the full year’s learning.

**Special note for Grade 1 (starting 2025–2026)**

- From 2025–2026 onward, **Grade 1 teachers must administer all DIBELS subtests, including Phonemic Segmentation Fluency (PSF), during all three assessment windows (Fall, Winter, Spring) to all students.**

### 1.3. Grades 2–8 (English Program)

The Grades 2–8 row groups all these grades together and focuses on **DIBELS**.

**September–October (Fall DIBELS)**

- Students in **Grades 2–8** complete **DIBELS** early in the year.
- These results help identify students who are below benchmark in key reading skills.

**November**

- A **report card is due** in November.
- Report card comments and marks incorporate Fall DIBELS results and classroom performance.

**January (Winter DIBELS)**

- Students in Grades 2–8 complete **DIBELS (Winter)**.
- This is a key checkpoint for monitoring progress, especially for students receiving intervention.

**Intervention period (November–April)**

- A **dark grey bar** spans the months after Winter DIBELS.
- Teachers focus on **targeted interventions** with students who did not meet benchmarks.

**March**

- A **report card is due** in March, summarizing mid‑year progress and incorporating Winter DIBELS data.

**April (Spring DIBELS – with asterisk)**

- Students complete **DIBELS (Spring)** again.
- The label shows **“*DIBELS”**, and the footnote explains the asterisk:
  - **If a student did not meet the benchmark in the Winter DIBELS**, teachers must administer **all subtests** of DIBELS for that student in April.
  - This applies even if the student met benchmark on some subtests but missed on at least one. In that case, all subtests are still given in April for that grade level.

**June**

- A final **report card is due** in June.

### 1.4. Key English Program Footnote (all relevant grades)

The asterisk note under the English chart states:

- Teachers must administer **all subtests** for any student who **did not meet the benchmark in the Winter DIBELS assessment**.
- Even if a student was at or above benchmark on some subtests but below on at least one (often shown as yellow or red), **all subtests at that grade level must still be given in April**.

In simple terms: **Winter is the main “checkpoint.”** If a student is behind in Winter, they receive complete re‑testing in Spring along with continued intervention.

## 2. French Immersion Program Assessment Schedule

The French Immersion chart has more assessment types because students are learning both **French and literacy skills**. It is organized by:

- **Grade bands**: Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grades 3–5, Grades 6–8
- **Time**: Before school year, September through June
- **Key assessments**:
  - **Kindergarten questionnaire**
  - **CTOPP‑2** (phonological processing – usually in English)
  - **THAFoL** (a French literacy/phonological awareness assessment)
  - **DIBELS** (English literacy)
  - **IDAPEL** (a French reading/phonological assessment)

### 2.1. Kindergarten (French Immersion)

**Before school year**

- Families complete a **Kindergarten questionnaire**, similar to the English Program.

- This assesses early phonological skills that support reading.

**November**

- A **report card is due** in November.

**January (THAFoL)**

- Students complete **THAFoL (Winter)**.
- THAFoL focuses on early French language and literacy skills.

**Intervention period (roughly November–April)**

**March**

- A **report card is due** in March.

**April (CTOPP‑2 again)**

- Kindergarten French Immersion students complete **CTOPP‑2 (Spring)** again in April.
- This allows staff to see progress in phonological skills from fall to spring.

**June**

- A final **report card is due** in June.

### 2.2. Grade 1 (French Immersion)

**September–October (THAFoL)**

**April (DIBELS and *THAFoL – Spring)**

- In April, Grade 2 French Immersion students complete:
  - **DIBELS (Spring)** – English literacy check
  - **THAFoL (Spring)** – shown as **“*THAFoL”** with an asterisk
- The asterisk means:
  - If a student **did not meet the Winter benchmark** on THAFoL, **all THAFoL subtests** must be administered again in April.

**June**

- A **report card is due** in June.

### 2.4. Grades 3–5 (French Immersion)

In Grades 3–5, students have **both French and English literacy assessments**.

**September–October (Fall DIBELS and IDAPEL)**

- Students complete:
  - **DIBELS (Fall)** – English literacy

  - Identify students needing intervention in English, French, or both.

**Intervention period (November–April)**

- A **dark grey bar** across the mid‑year months indicates the ongoing **intervention period**.

**March**

- A **report card is due** in March.

**April (Spring *DIBELS and *IDAPEL)**

- The asterisks mean:
  - For any student who **did not meet Winter benchmarks** on DIBELS and/or IDAPEL, **all subtests** of that assessment must be administered again in April.

**June**

- A final **report card is due** in June.

### 2.5. Grades 6–8 (French Immersion)

For Grades 6–8, the focus is on **DIBELS** as the main standardized literacy measure.

**September–October (Fall DIBELS)**

- Students complete **DIBELS (Fall)**.

**March**

- A **report card is due** in March.

**April (Spring *DIBELS)**

- Students complete **“*DIBELS”** in April.
- The asterisk indicates that if a student **did not meet the Winter benchmark**, teachers must give **all DIBELS subtests** again in April.

**June**

- A final **report card is due** in June.

### 2.6. Key French Immersion Footnote (all relevant grades)

The footnote under the French Immersion chart states:

- Teachers must administer **all subtests** of a test (THAFoL, IDAPEL, or DIBELS) for any student who **did not meet the benchmark in the Winter assessment period**.
- Even if the student was above benchmark on some subtests but missed **at least one**, **all subtests for that grade level must still be given again in April**.

This mirrors the practice in the English Program but extends it to **all relevant assessments** used in French Immersion.

## 3. How to Read and Use These Schedules

Taken together, both charts communicate a consistent assessment cycle:

1. **Baseline in Fall (September–October)**
   - Students are assessed early in the year to determine starting points.

2. **First formal reporting in November**
   - Report cards capture early progress and initial assessment results.

3. **Key checkpoint in Winter (January)**
   - Students are reassessed (DIBELS, THAFoL, IDAPEL, CTOPP‑2 depending on grade and program).
   - Winter results drive decisions about who needs extra help.

4. **Intervention period (roughly November–April)**
   - The dark grey bars show the months where teachers focus on targeted instruction and intervention.

5. **Ongoing reporting in March**
   - Report cards in March reflect progress and the impact of interventions.

6. **Spring verification in April (with asterisks)**
   - Students complete Spring assessments.
   - For those who were **below benchmark in Winter**, teachers must administer **all subtests again** in April to get a full picture of progress.

7. **Final reporting in June**
   - June report cards summarize overall achievement and growth over the year.

In simple terms: **Fall establishes where students are, Winter checks whether they are on track, the months in between are used for targeted support, and Spring verifies growth—especially for students who needed extra help.**
