    <h2>Understanding Scores</h2>
    <p class="description">Learn how to interpret assessment scores and make data-informed decisions.</p>
    
    <h3>Score Categories</h3>
    <p>Most literacy assessments categorize student performance into benchmark categories:</p>
    
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Action</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Above Benchmark</strong> (Green)</td>
                <td>Student is performing at or above grade-level expectations</td>
                <td>Continue with core instruction; may provide enrichment</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>At Benchmark</strong> (Green)</td>
                <td>Student is meeting grade-level expectations with core instruction</td>
                <td>Continue with core instruction and monitor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Below Benchmark</strong> (Yellow)</td>
                <td>Student is at some risk and may need additional support</td>
                <td>Provide Tier 2 interventions and progress monitor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Well Below Benchmark</strong> (Red)</td>
                <td>Student is at high risk and needs intensive support</td>
                <td>Provide Tier 3 interventions and frequent progress monitoring</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Common Assessment Measures</h3>
    
    <h4>DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phoneme Segmentation Fluency (PSF):</strong> Measures ability to segment words into individual phonemes</li>
        <li><strong>Nonsense Word Fluency (NWF):</strong> Assesses letter-sound correspondence and blending</li>
        <li><strong>Oral Reading Fluency (ORF):</strong> Measures reading accuracy and fluency with connected text</li>
        <li><strong>Maze:</strong> Assesses reading comprehension</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>FastBridge</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>earlyReading:</strong> Composite measure for K-1 students</li>
        <li><strong>aReading:</strong> Adaptive reading assessment for comprehension</li>
        <li><strong>CBMreading:</strong> Curriculum-based measure of oral reading fluency</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Understanding Percentiles and Standard Scores</h3>
    <p><strong>Percentile Rank:</strong> Indicates the percentage of students in the norm group who scored at or below a given score. For example, a percentile rank of 75 means the student scored as well as or better than 75% of students.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Standard Score:</strong> A score that describes how far above or below the mean (average) a student performed. Standard scores typically have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.</p>
    
    <h3>Making Data-Informed Decisions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Look at trends over time, not just a single score</li>
        <li>Consider multiple measures and data sources</li>
        <li>Compare student performance to both benchmarks and their own previous performance</li>
        <li>Evaluate the rate of improvement (slope) for students receiving interventions</li>
        <li>Use data to determine if interventions should be continued, modified, or discontinued</li>
        <li>Consider other factors such as attendance, language background, and specific learning needs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Questions to Ask When Reviewing Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Is the student meeting grade-level benchmarks?</li>
        <li>Is the student making adequate progress over time?</li>
        <li>Are there specific skill areas where the student struggles?</li>
        <li>Is the current intervention effective? (Is the student's rate of improvement adequate?)</li>
        <li>Do we need to adjust the intensity, duration, or type of intervention?</li>
        <li>What are the student's strengths that we can build upon?</li>
    </ul>
